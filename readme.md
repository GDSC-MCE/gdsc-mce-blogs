#GDSC MCE Blogs

This repo is what GDSC MCE uses to power their blogging website [gdsc-mce-blogs](https://gdsc-mce-blogs.com).

It uses Notion as a CMS, fetching content from Notion and then uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) to render everything.

The site is then deployed to [Vercel](http://vercel.com).

## About GDSC

GDSC is a Google Developers program for university students, designed to help them build their mobile and web development skills and knowledge. It is open to any student, ranging from novice developers who are just starting, to advanced developers who want to further their skills. It is intended to be a space for students to learn and collaborate as they solve mobile and web development problems.

Google Developer Student Clubs (DSC) are community groups for students from any academic background in their undergraduate or graduate term. By joining a DSC, students build their professional and personal networks, get access to Google developer resources, and work together to build solutions for local problems in a peer-to-peer learning environment.
